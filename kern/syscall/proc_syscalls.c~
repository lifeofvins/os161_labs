/*file con implementazione della system call exit
In OS161, you can end user programs by calling the “_exit( )” system call. Without an implementation of _exit( ), the threads created to handle user programs will hang around forever, executing an infinite loop in the user space and taking up a lot of CPU time.
*The function _exit() terminates the calling process "immediately". Any open file descriptors belonging to the process are closed; any children of the process are inherited by process 1, init, and the process's parent is sent a SIGCHLD signal. 
*Tale funzione deve effettuare le chiamate a as_destroy() e thread_exit()
*void as_destroy(struct addrspace *as);
void thread_exit(void);
*
